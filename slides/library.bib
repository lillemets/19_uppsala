	abstract = {We attempt to clarify, and suggest how to avoid, several serious misunderstandings about and fallacies of causal inference. These issues concern some of the most fundamental advantages and disadvantages of each basic research design. Problems include improper use of hypothesis tests for covariate balance between the treated and control groups, and the consequences of using randomization, blocking before randomization and matching after assignment of treatment to achieve covariate balance. Applied researchers in a wide range of scientiﬁc disciplines seem to fall prey to one or more of these fallacies and as a result make suboptimal design or analysis choices. To clarify these points, we derive a new four-part decomposition of the key estimation errors in making causal inferences. We then show how this decomposition can help scholars from different experimental and observational research traditions to understand better each other’s inferential problems and attempted solutions.},

	abstract = {Twenty years has passed since Finland joined the European Union in 1995. Agriculture was one of the key areas in which signiﬁcant changes were both anticipated and realised. Besides the European-wide structural change towards larger production units and the steeply decreasing number of farms, the EU's agricultural policy has brought about signiﬁcant changes in farming as a livelihood and the ways in which it is practiced in Finland. These changes involve environmental considerations related to fertilisation or tillage practices, for example, but they are also reﬂected in wider meaning-making related to what farming fundamentally is about. Using the concept of good farming as the key, we explore how the introduced agri-environmental policies have changed farming practices and how this is reﬂected in the ways that good farming ideals are understood and constituted among different farmers. The analysis is based on interviews in which farmers describe their farming practices, purposes and the inﬂuence of policies. Our results suggest that the ideals related to good farming are diversifying and changing as the ways of gaining a livelihood through farming changes. This change occurs as the ideals are renegotiated when performing new voluntary or forced practices. Good farming ideals do not only function as a cultural barrier to the adoption of new practices, but they can actively contribute to the accommodation and development of the practices.},

Given the risks posed by climate change, particularly the changes in extreme weather events, the question of how to adapt to these changes and mitigate their negative impacts has received great attention from policy makers. The overall goals of this study are to examine whether farmers adapt to extreme weather events through crop diversification and which factors influence farmers’ decisions on crop diversification against extreme weather events in China. To limit the scope of this study, we focus on drought and flood events only. Based on a unique large-scale household survey in nine provinces, this study finds that farmers respond to extreme weather events by increasing crop diversification. Their decision to diversify crops is significantly influenced by their experiences of extreme weather events in the previous year. Such results are understandable because farmers’ behaviors are normally based on their expectations. Moreover, household characteristics also affect farmers’ decisions on crop diversification strategy, and their effects differ by farmers’ age and gender. This paper concludes with several policy implications.},

At the household level, we distinguish three types of diversiﬁcation as opposed to grain production only: within-farm (non-grain production) activities, local off-farm activities, and migration. We ﬁnd that land availability stimulates on-farm diversiﬁcation. Local off-farm activities are mostly driven by households' asset positions and working resources, while migration decisions strongly depend on the household size and composition. At the individual level, we analyze the determinants of participation in three different types of jobs as compared to agricultural work: local off-farm employment, local self-employment and migration. We ﬁnd a clear gender and age bias in access to off-farm activities that are mostly undertaken by male and by young people. The households' asset positions as well as village networks are found to strongly affect participation in off-farm activities.},

The purpose of this paper is to perform an exploratory investigation of the relationship between the spatial distribution of regional income and of regional development funds among 145 European regions over 1989–1999. Using a set of tools of spatial statistics, we ﬁrst detect the presence of global and local spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of regional per capita incomes, traducing that rich (poor) regions tend to be clustered close to other rich (poor) regions, and in the distribution of regional growth rate and regional funds. Second, the results of LISA statistics conclude to the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the form of two spatial clusters of rich and poor regions over the decade, highlighting the persistence of a signiﬁcant core-periphery pattern among European regions. Finally, an exploratory analysis reveals a negative correlation between growth and initial income, that tends to indicate b-convergence. A positive relationship between regional growth and structural funds is identiﬁed among the signiﬁcant results as well. Only Andalucia, Galicia and Sterea Ellada show atypical linkages. These results suggest that further research should include spatial eﬀects and the distribution of regional funds in the spatial econometric estimation of regional convergence in Europe.},

The study is based on accounting data from the farms of intensive agriculture in Wielkopolska Province, collected by the Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics in Warsaw in 2004-2009. It was demonstrated that diversified farms achieve similar economic efficiency indicators as specialized farms. At the same time it was proven that the farms with production specializing in breeding cattle, implement their function of “guardians of the countryside” in the same degree or even better. Thus, the main hypothesis of the study formulated on the basis of studying literature was rejected. It said that: specialized farms achieve higher economic efficiency with lower environmental sustainability of the production than diversified farms. In the diversified farms there is higher environmental sustainability of production at lower economic efficiency than in specialized farms.},

More recently though, there have been small movements of people to rural environments seeking similar lifestyle changes. These movements to rural locales have been popularly referred to as treechange. Previous research on exurban migration has primarily focused on quantifying the migration process and attributes of the migrators. In contrast, this paper presents some preliminary ﬁndings on the impact of urban-rural migration on a small, semi-rural receiving area north of Melbourne. More specifically, it explores the impact that exurban migration has on local housing markets such as increases in house prices, decreases in affordability and declines in rental stock. The research also illustrates the divisions that appear in local communities between traditional residents and ‘newcomers’ over amenity issues and economic development.},

This article attempts to ﬁll the void by surveying and evaluating the situation in the Member States of the European Union (EU) and some other countries. Farmers are often exempted from VAT for administrative and political reasons. But this means that the VAT on their inputs cannot be ‘washed out’ through the tax deduction/credit mechanism. It then has to be borne by the farmers themselves or becomes an indeterminate and capricious element in consumer prices. To compensate farmers for the uncompensated VAT on inputs, the EU has devised a ﬂat-rate scheme that permits them to charge a presumptive rate (approximately equal to the effective VAT rate on sector-wide inputs) on their sales to taxable agro-processing ﬁrms which, in turn, are permitted to take a deduction for this ﬂat-rate addition from the VAT on their sales. Obviously, the ﬂat-rate scheme is an arbitrary way of trying to achieve equal treatment between exempt and taxable farmers and between exempt farm products and other taxable goods and services. Full taxation, subject to the general threshold, appears to be the preferred choice.},

Using a panel dataset over the period 2004–2010, we compare the results obtained from pooled-OLS and dynamic panel GMM estimators.

The concept of frames refers to relatively distinct and coherent sets of meaning attributed to a concept, such as food security. The article shows that in the European Union (EU) food security is a consensus frame which can be broken down in six conﬂicting and overlapping sub-frames and which has complicated the debates about the future of the CAP. We demonstrate that during the CAP-reform debates of 2009–2012 a variety of food security arguments were deployed by a broad range of stakeholders, who attached different meanings and made different claims about the relationship between the CAP and food security. Inductive frame analysis reveals that the consensus frame of food security can be broken down into six conﬂicting and overlapping sub-frames: (1) the productionist frame, (2) the environmental frame, (3) the development frame, (4) the free trade frame, (5) the regional frame, and (6) the food sovereignty frame. Each of these frames was invoked by a speciﬁc group of stakeholders, whereby the productionist and environmental frames were deployed most often. The European Commission, meanwhile, invoked various frames at the same time in its communications. As a result of these various framings of the relationship between the CAP and food security, a clear political vision on this relationship is lacking. We conclude that politicians and policymakers may need to develop a coherent vision on what food security entails, and on how the CAP could contribute to both European and global food security.},

	abstract = {Recent European research projects have developed approaches that downscale land use related results of economic models. These results are primarily downscaled from the national or regional scale to a spatial resolution appropriate for environmental impact analysis. Different studies represent the interactions between the economic and geographic components of the land system in different ways. This paper explores how interactions between economic and geographic aspects of the land system can be strengthened in modelling studies. It does so by comparing two existing approaches (CLUE and Capri-Spat) for the European Union (EU27). CLUE focuses on disaggregating national level changes in claims for agricultural and urban area to a 1 km × 1 km grid, explicitly addressing consequences of changing demands for agricultural and urban area for other land uses such as (semi-) natural vegetation. Whereas, CAPRI-Spat is concerned with agricultural land use, disaggregating cropping shares, animal stocking densities, yield and agricultural input use for mapping units. The mapping units are clusters of 1 km × 1 km pixels considered homogenous in terms of soil, slope, land cover and administrative region. This paper discusses differences between the two models relating to geographical units, distribution algorithm and most importantly diverging interpretation of ‘agricultural land’, in relationship to their respective concepts and objectives. It concludes that a stronger integration of the geographic and economic aspects can be achieved by linking the overall land use dynamics simulated by CLUE to the detailed representation of the agricultural sector by CAPRI-Spat. Therefore, relative changes in land use classes at 1 km × 1 km resolution obtained from CLUE simulations update a priori means in CAPRI-Spat entering a Highest Posterior Density Estimator. The ﬁndings of this study contribute to our overall capacity to integrate approaches from different disciplines in the integrated analysis of land change and the ex ante assessment of environmental and economic effects of agricultural policies.},

As hosts offering local food, stories, and various activities, they mediate a strong farm identity. The article also explores how farm identities change through three processes by which the ‘new’ work of tourism destabilizes identities. One is a shift in the meaning of farmer identity. Another is the gradual change towards a new master identity, and thirdly there is a multiplicity of identities that shift as they relate to various social memberships and settings.},

It is empirically investigated how policy funds redistribute their effects among regions with different levels of rurality and economic development according to their degree and form of integration. This analysis is performed by constructing and applying a multiregional Input–Output model at a very high level of geographical disaggregation (NUTS 3 level). Alternative allocation of funds across regions (policy scenarios) are considered in order to assess redistributive impacts of possible CAP reforms. Results show that the impacts generated by the CAP across space do not only depend on the initial allocation of funds but also on intersectoral and interregional linkages. This evidence implies that even a radical reallocation of funds, though it may contribute to reducing regional imbalances, is less redistributive than expected.},

Although previous research has shown that this counterurbanisation model is insufﬁcient to explain rural immigration in sparsely populated countries, this paper shows that also within core regions, more diverse conceptualisations of migration into rural areas are required. This is achieved by distinguishing popular, average, and less-popular rural living areas in the northern Netherlands, on the basis of average house prices, and by analysing the migration ﬂows to these areas. Data from Housing Research of the Netherlands demonstrate that popular rural areas attract more highly educated people and people moving from urban areas compared with less-popular and average rural areas. For movers to less-popular areas, being near to family and friends is more important. The characteristics of the movers to popular rural areas ﬁt very well with the counterurbanisation story. Less-popular rural areas in the Netherlands share personal reasons as an important motivation for in-migration with more remote rural areas in Europe. This indicates that conceptualisations of periphery and remoteness have to be considered within the local, regional, and national context.},

We ﬁnd that, overall, EU transfers enable faster growth in the recipient regions as intended, but we estimate that in 36\% of the recipient regions the transfer intensity exceeds the aggregate efﬁciency maximizing level and in 18\% of the regions a reduction of transfers would not even reduce their growth.

	abstract = {Structural change provides the possibility of increasing the competitiveness and efﬁciency of the entire agricultural sector through a better allocation of productive factors. Amongst the productive factors, land is the one that most often limits farm development. This paper seeks to identify determinants of intended changes in farm size (represented by farmed area and measured as a reduction, expansion or no change) identiﬁed as stated intentions expressed through survey information, under two different Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) scenarios: (1) the Baseline, characterised by the Health Check policy as of 2009; and (2) a No-CAP scenario, assuming the elimination of all CAP payments and regulatory measures. Results highlight that CAP abolishment strongly reduces the intention to increase the amount of farmed area; the determinants of change in farmed area also change sharply amongst the two scenarios. Geographic variables, and farm characteristics such as farm organisation and the number of on-farm employees are relevant to explain the farmed area expansion. On the contrary, without the CAP, the relation between household and farm has strong effects on the different directions of change of farmed area. The results conﬁrm that the different single payments scheme models affect the changes in demand of land.},

	abstract = {State agencies have been encouraging the development of different enterprises to diversify farm incomes in an effort to retain farmers in business, attract new entrants to agriculture and promote regional development. Entrepreneurship and farming are known to be driven by a complex set of goals including those which are economic and intrinsic in nature. However, little information is available regarding the set of goals that drive agriculture entrepreneurship, preventing state agencies to adequately target potential diversiﬁers. This paper provides a better understanding of the range of goals, both ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial, that are important in farmers’ decisions to diversify their operations. The generation of additional income, the continuance of farming and ranching, and the enhancement of quality of life are among the most important diversiﬁcation goals in Texas. A principal component factor analysis performed on the importance ratings of diversiﬁcation goals resulted in six dimensions: (F1) Reduce Uncertainty and Risk; (F2) Grow and Service Markets; (F3) Enhanced Financial Condition; (F4) Individual Aspirations and Pursuits; (F5) Revenues Enhancement; and (F6) Family Connections. The study also examined the relationship between various entrepreneur and farm characteristics and the goal pursuit dimensions. Operator’s age, number of generations the farm had been in the family, household income, number of farm employees, and distance to an urbanized area inﬂuence types of goals pursued through diversiﬁcation.},

It describes the development of the simulation model for the Irish local economy (SMILE) model. SMILE is a static and dynamic spatial microsimulation designed to analyse the impact of policy change and economic development on rural areas in Ireland. This paper focuses on the static model. First, we describe the European and Irish policy environment and indicate the importance of building spatial models to analyse change in rural Ireland. Second, we review existing literature on regional and local modelling techniques and the use of spatial models as tools for policy analysis. Third, we describe the SMILE static model. The model generates synthetic spatially referenced population for the Irish Republic at the small area level—the population micro data is produced for district electoral divisions (DEDs). Finally, we show how data from other sources can be linked to the static model output. We link data from the Irish National Farm Survey on farm system, income and off-farm employment of operator to the SMILE static model. We use this example to show its potential as a tool for policy analysis.},

Evidence of absolute convergence in farm incomes is explained by short-run adjustments towards equilibrium or target incomes conditional upon prices, technology and farm business size, with farm business growth conditional upon survival found to have had no signiﬁcant redistributive eﬀect.},

Regression analysis is used to evaluate the relationship between allocated funds (dependent variable) and factors of territorial disadvantage (explanatory variables) covering the 20-year period 1994-2013 and approximately 90\% of total Community expenditure. The analysis reveals that both coordination and compatibility with territorial cohesion of the various areas of Community policy have not always improved in response to major policy reforms. The territorial ‘vocation’ of overall Community spending is weakly linked to its distribution among different policies, but it crucially depends upon how each policy area defines appropriate allocation mechanisms and interventions, based upon the characteristics of each region and its ‘local’ needs.},

A critical appraisal of the CAP impact in terms of regional growth is carried out. Firstly from a strictly conceptual and methodological point of view, then by analysing more in detail how CAP reform (of both Pillar I and II) might have actually affected the role of the CAP in promoting (or hindering) regional growth and, therefore, convergence. Empirical evidence provided by the different available methodologies has progressively emerged in the very last years. Though a conclusive answer on the impact of the reform can not be drawn, it still emerges that the role of CAP design and implementation in affecting regional growth and convergence is usually underestimated and often neglected in the discussions about the future of the CAP. At the same time, however, this role is not univocal and strongly case-specific, as it substantially differs across regions according to their socio-economic structure and how reforms are jointly implemented.},

The ﬁndings show that in the process of CAP reform decision-making, European institutions justiﬁed the CAP with a transformation of key discourses (productivist, multi-functional and neo-liberal) by emphasising the hugely popular environmental element while, at the same time, employing a strong productivist discourse at the level of measures and the budgetary distribution between the EU member states and farmers’ groups. In order to retain a strong CAP as well as the current distribution of ﬁnancial resources, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council employed greening as a justiﬁcation strategy as well as a productivist discourse as a major component in determining CAP measures.},

The farmers surveyed were mostly specialised in field cropping, dairy and beef. Respondents had to indicate their intentions in two CAP scenarios: firstly in a ‘CAP continuation scenario’; and secondly in a ‘No CAP scenario’ where the CAP would be fully removed from 2014 onwards. ‘Intentions’ relates to their intended ten-year strategy regarding exit and, for those intending to remain, to their use of production factors and diversification activities. The determinants of farm exits induced by the CAP removal were investigated using Probit models. In addition to descriptive statistics on intentions, a cluster analysis was performed to highlight the different effects of the CAP removal on the farmers' intentions, both in terms of exit and in terms of production factors and diversification activities. For the majority of respondents CAP removal would not change their intentions. However, around 21 percent who would remain in farming if the CAP were continued, would exit if the CAP were removed. The Probit models showed that farmers located in the Centre region and in less favoured areas were more likely to exit in the absence of the CAP while they would remain if the CAP continued, a result which contrasts with the determinants of ‘natural exits’, that is to say of exits whatever the scenario. The cluster analysis highlighted the fact that responses to the removal of the CAP varied across farm systems.},

	abstract = {As a consequence of the European Union (EU) enlargement in 2004 there has been a reshaping of funds allocated by the EU both in favour of an endogenous rural development, part of Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and also in terms of direct payments towards ag-commodities financed by Pillar 1 of the CAP. The European Commission, in order to evaluate the impact, role and function of the CAP, has set up an annual survey on a sample of European farms belonging to the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). By using the FADN dataset for the period 2004-2012 in 25 EU Member States, this paper has assessed by indexes of concentration whether funds allocated by Pillars 1 and 2 of the CAP have reduced economic disparities in some EU Member States. Findings have shown that there has been a drop of inequality distribution in terms of financial subsidies in European farms allocated to strengthen the rural development. Focusing the attention on financial supports to disadvantaged rural areas, territorial disparities appear quite diversified among EU Member States.},

Trends in various types of diversi"cation are described in England and Wales * as recorded in the Farm Business Survey. Although hirework is the most frequently reported diversi"cation activity, renting out of farm buildings is the only activity considered here where there has been a substantial increase in participation over the last 10 years. Furthermore, for most types of diversi"cation, the rate of exit is similar in magnitude to that of entry. When they are present, most types of diversi"cation make a relatively small contribution to average business income. The probability of observing diversi"cation is strongly related to farm size and type. A particular concern is that most types of diversi"cation activities considered here may be more di\$cult to pursue on small farms, especially within less favoured areas. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Farms have been stratified into functions of their typology of farming and their geographical localization. Research findings have pointed out that specialized farms as dairy farms and granivores ones have had the highest levels of technical efficiency compared to mixed farms and wine farms. To sum up, financial subsidies allocated by the Common Agricultural Policy have had a positive impact towards farmers, both increasing the technical efficiency and also in reducing the socio-economic marginalization of Bulgarian rural areas.},

	abstract = {A considerable body of research on farmers’ behaviour is based on the surveys regarding their behavioural intentions. The theory of planned behaviour states that while the formation of intentions normally precedes behaviour, several factors affect the realisation of the intended behaviour. Therefore, the usefulness of ex-ante surveys for predicting farmers’ behaviour requires more attention to reduce the potential biases in such analyses. The paper investigates how well the farmers’ intentions correspond with the behaviour in cases of farm exits, continuation of farming and farm size changes in Estonia. Based on the farm survey in 2007, the follow-up survey in 2011, and paying agency’s registry data, the ex-ante data on the intentions is combined with ex-post data on actual behaviour. A recursive bivariate probit regression is used to study the effects of selected socioeconomic characteristics on the probabilities of intended and realised behaviour, and the effects of stated intentions on actual behaviour. The results indicate that the usefulness of intentions in predicting actual behaviour differs, depending on the nature of the question in the farm life cycle context. Intentions are found to be a better predictor of actual behaviour when the considered event is regarded as positive (continuation of farming and farm growth) rather than negative (farm exit or farm shrinkage).},

This current paper aims to investigate the effects of such socioeconomic factors on the probabilities of farm growth, decline and exit relative to retaining the previous farm size. The survey and agricultural registers’ data are used for multinomial logit estimation. The results indicate that the farm growth probability is highest in the 40-49 year age group. The availability of successors significantly reduced farm exit probability, and the level of education of the farm operator increased the farm growth probability. While off-farm work was more probable in smaller farms and in cases of more educated and younger farm managers, it was evident that the off-farm employment of the farm operator significantly increased the probability of farm exit. While the larger farms have a higher probability of remaining in business, and lower probability to exit or decline, they do not have higher growth probability. Participation in a semi-subsistence farming scheme reduces the exit probability. It has been shown that farms founded during the beginning of transition due to restitution have lower decline and growth probabilities, indicating that such farmers are emotionally more inclined to maintain the farms of their forefathers.},

	abstract = {The investment support has been considered as a principal vehicle for enhancing competitiveness of the Czech agriculture since the early days of the economic transition. However so far, little attention has been paid to the evaluation of actual effects of the corresponding support programmes. The objective of this paper is to assess economic and other effects of the measure 121 “Modernisation of Agricultural Holdings” of the RDP 2007-2013 on the Czech farms. The counterfactual approach is adopted investigating what would have happened if the supported producers did not participate in the programme and then comparing the result indicators. The quantitative analysis of programme effects is complemented by a qualitative survey on 20 farms which received the investment support between 2008 and 2010. The quantitative assessment showed significant benefits of the investment support in terms of business expansion (GVA) and productivity (GVA/labour costs) improvements. These results were confirmed by the qualitative survey. It showed that production expansion and productivity increase were primary objectives of the investment strategies on most of the farms. The public support enabled farms to achieve these strategic objectives. The respondents of the survey declared that the supported investment was important for their prosperity however, we could not prove it in the quantitative assessment in terms of profit and cost/revenue ratio. Finally, the issue of deadweight of the investment support is discussed: the figures on very low net investment relatively to the provided public support at the sector level and answers of respondents indicate possible significant deadweight, however, the insight is incomplete, since it does not take into account post accession restructuring of the sector and multiannual and multi-enterprise character of investment at the farm level.},

The analysis reveals a positive and significant treatment effect of the LFA scheme for farm sales and the area under cultivation. Participants in AE schemes are found to significantly increase the area under cultivation (in particular grassland), resulting in a decrease of livestock densities. Furthermore, participation in AE programs significantly reduced the purchase of farm chemicals (fertilizer, pesticide). We also find substantial differences in the treatment effect between individual farms (heterogeneous treatment effects). Farms which can generate the largest benefit from the program are most likely to participate.},

The instruments are derived from a simple theoretical model of government decision-making in which governments are responsive to the attributes of places and their populations, rather than to the attributes of individuals, in making allocation decisions across space, and have a social welfare function that is spatially weakly separable, that is, that the budgeting process behaves as if it is multi-stage with respect to administrative districts and sub-districts. The spatial instrumental variables model is then estimated and tested with a single cross-section of Indonesian census data. The results offer support to the identification strategy proposed but also highlight some critical issues affecting validity.},

Furthermore, we develop an empirical framework for analysing the size and the timing of adjustment costs and investment utilisation. We apply this methodology to a large panel data set of Danish pig producers with 9,281 observations between 1996 and 2008. The paper further contributes with a thorough discussion of the calculation and deflation of capital input from microeconomic data. We estimate an output distance function as a stochastic frontier model and explain the estimated technical inefficiencies with lagged investments, farm size and age of the farmer. We allow for interaction effects between these variables and derive the formula for calculating the marginal effects on technical efficiency. The results show that investments have a negative effect on farm efficiency in the year of the investment and the year after accruing from adjustment costs. There is a large positive effect on efficiency two and three years after the investment. The farmer’s age and the farm size significantly influence technical efficiency, as well as the effect of investments on adjustment costs and investment utilisation. These results are robust to different ways of measuring capital.},

Unfortunately, no thorough scientific research has been done to find out whether the emerging helps to increase the ef ficiency. The aim of this paper is to estimate the efficiency of Estonian rural municipalities and to identify the factors that influence their efficiency. In this study we use a two stage analysis. In the first stage, we use the DEA Slacks - Based Model’s ( SBM) output - oriented approach. In the second stage, we use the Fractional Regression Model (FRM) to determine relevant exogenous factors that are associated with efficiency. 170 Estonian rural municipalities have been analysed. According to the DEA results , 28\% of municipalities (48) are efficient, the average efficiency of municipalities is 0.762. The analysis implies that there are considerable differences between smaller and larger rural municipalities. FRM results revealed that larger share of subsidies characterize inefficient municipalities. The weaker the municipality, the more state support the municipality must receive. A larger share of people with a higher education increases the efficiency, it is related to higher salaries and therefore higher re venue to the municipality. Elderly residents in the population increases the efficiency, however it isn’t sustainable in the long - run because more inputs are needed to offer various public services. The results indicate that the further away a municipality is from the capital, the more inefficient the municipality becomes.},

One of these promising methods is the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) approach.

We also test the robustness of the results to hidden bias with sensitivity analysis. Furthermore we split the sample in more homogenous subsamples in order to increase the robustness of the results.

Currently, ecologists most commonly analyze presence-only data by adding randomly chosen "pseudo-absences" to the data such that it can be analyzed using logistic regression, an approach which has weaknesses in model specification, in interpretation, and in implementation. To address these issues, we propose Poisson point process modeling of the intensity of presences. We also derive a link between the proposed approach and logistic regression---specifically, we show that as the number of pseudo-absences increases (in a regular or uniform random arrangement), logistic regression slope parameters and their standard errors converge to those of the corresponding Poisson point process model. We discuss the practical implications of these results. In particular, point process modeling offers a framework for choice of the number and location of pseudo-absences, both of which are currently chosen by ad hoc and sometimes ineffective methods in ecology, a point which we illustrate by example.},

	abstract = {Although a recent rise in timber prices seems to counter the long-term trend of declining proﬁtability of timber production, the development of additional sources of income still constitutes a strategic challenge for forest enterprises. Furthermore, increasing interest of stakeholders in various forestry goods and services requires dealing comprehensively with the potentials of multifunctional forestry. In fact, forest enterprises may be engaged not only in providing a range of forestry-based outputs but also with ventures unrelated to forests. Nevertheless, there is still little empirical evidence concerning the economic signiﬁcance of diversiﬁcation. Established economic monitoring schemes traditionally concentrate on timber production. Political interest and forest certiﬁcation are typically restricted to forest-based activities. In this paper, the empirical evidence regarding auxiliary activities as documented by the Austrian accountancy network of larger forest enterprises is appraised for the ﬁrst time. A set of economic key ﬁgures can be derived for a considerable range of activities. On average, timber production is still dominating by far, other activities contributing in total only to an equivalent of some 2.5\% of the timber proﬁts. A range of methodical limitations associated with the data collected so far underpin the necessity to interpret results prudently. Several amendments are identiﬁed which could substantially improve the significance of the empirical investigations.},

	abstract = {The Chinese government has increasingly turned to agricultural industry policy as a means of promoting rural development, which have not necessarily led to an improvement in rural incomes nor to the achievement of other social and environmental goals. Emergy synthesis methods were applied to four agricultural production systems, i.e., two local traditional production systems as maize plantation and pond ﬁsh farming, one scaled Shaoxing duck (Anas Platyrhyncha var. domestica) rearing system, and one newly introduced specialty production system of common mushroom (Agaricus Bisporus) cultivation, in Weishan county of Shandong province of China in the year 2007, to assess and compare their environmental performances. Additionally, aiming at understanding the beneﬁts and driving forces of agricultural diversiﬁcation, environmental performance results were contrasted with traditional economic indicators. As indicated by EYR, ELR and ESI, it can be clearly shown that the scaled duck rearing and newly introduced common mushroom cultivation alternatives are not in a sustainable pattern, although having better economic performance than maize cropping and pond ﬁsh farming. Nevertheless, the development of rural agricultural diversiﬁcation is also affected by land accessibility, investment ability and even labor availability. Therefore, achieving a proﬁtable and environmental sustainable diversiﬁed farming system is not an easy task in Weishan area as well as in whole China. It is unwise to encourage development of agricultural diversiﬁcation in current manners without too much consideration on environmental degradation.},

	abstract = {Although farm-based tourism has a long tradition, particularly within Europe, farm diversiﬁcation into tourism has, in recent years, become more widely seen as an effective means of addressing the socio-economic problems of rural areas in general and the agricultural sector in particular. Accordingly, not only has there been signiﬁcant growth in the supply of farm-based tourism in many countries (and evidence of rural development policies supporting such growth), but also increasing academic attention has been paid to the phenomenon. However, although a number of studies consider speciﬁc issues related to farm diversiﬁcation into tourism, such as marketing or ﬁnancial challenges, little or no research has been undertaken into the attitudes of farming families that have diversiﬁed. The purpose of this paper is to address this omission in the tourism literature. Based on a survey of farms in north-eastern England, it explores farmers’ attitudes to a variety of issues related to diversiﬁcation into tourism, including the socio-cultural context within which it occurs. In doing so, it both conﬁrms and challenges previously held assumptions regarding the problems of diversiﬁcation. In particular, however, it identiﬁes a widespread desire amongst farmers to maintain a distinction between the farm/farming business, suggesting that the development of farm tourism enterprises is an employment, as opposed to diversiﬁcation, issue. It concludes, therefore, that the role of public sector agencies in the support of farm tourism should be reassessed.},

This paper answers the question whether a sequence of observations from a process follow the same statistical distribution, and if not, where the exact change points are, so that observations within two consecutive change points follow the same distribution. We propose two different methods based on likelihood ratio test and cluster analysis to detect multiple change points when observations follow non-stationary Poisson process with diverse occurrence rates over time. Results from a comprehensive Monte Carlo study indicate satisfactory performance for the proposed methods. A well-known example is also considered to show the application of our ﬁndings in real world cases.},

A microeconomic approach is employed, based on firm data from FAME dataset combined with detailed subsidies information from DEFRA. The generalised method of moments (system GMM) is used to estimate the effect of CAP payments in both static and dynamic models of employment. The results suggest positive net spillovers of CAP payments to non-farm employment. Although the magnitude of the effect is small, it is economically significant. In general, Pillar 1 has a stronger positive employment effect relative to Pillar 2.

	abstract = {This paper examines the potential impact of agricultural and trade policy reform on land-use across the EU focussing particularly on the issue of land abandonment. Using a novel combined application of the well established CAPRI and Dyna-CLUE models it estimates the extent of change across Europe under removal of Pillar 1 support payments and trade liberalisation. Overall, it is estimated that around 8 per cent less land will be farmed under these reforms than under the baseline situation. However, some regions, areas and farm types face more signiﬁcant reductions. The reforms are particularly felt on livestock grazing farms situated in the more marginal areas of Europe, which also coincide with areas of high nature value. Therefore, farmland biodiversity is likely to be reduced in these areas. However, using a range of environmental indicators, relating to nutrient surpluses, GHG emissions, soil erosion and species abundance, an overall improvement in the environmental footprint of agriculture is likely. In addition, the economic efﬁciency of the agricultural sector will probably improve. The paper considers several possible options available to deal with any negative aspects of land abandonment. Following the FAO (2006), it is argued that untargeted, rather general agricultural policy measures which maintain land in production are likely to be an ineffective and inefﬁcient way to address the perceived negative consequences of abandonment. A more holistic approach to rural development is required, tailored to the speciﬁc context within each area.},

We explore whether this is true by conducting an econometric ex post evaluation of the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the three East German States Brandenburg, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt. Whereas previous studies have employed descriptive statistics or qualitative methods and have looked at single policy instruments in isolation, we apply a difference-in-differences estimator to analyze the employment effects of the entire portfolio of CAP measures simultaneously. Based on panel data at the county level, we ﬁnd that investment aids and transfers to less-favored areas had a zero marginal employment effect. We present evidence that full decoupling of direct payments in 2005 led to labor shedding, as it made transfer payments independent of factor allocation. Spending on modern technologies in processing and marketing and measures aimed at the development of rural areas led to job losses in agriculture. Agrienvironmental measures, on the other hand, kept labor-intensive technologies in production or induced them. This analysis calls into question whether an expansion of existing second pillar measures is a reasonable way to use funds modulated away from the ﬁrst pillar.},

This study investigates the impact of both coupled and decoupled EU CAP direct payments on rental values in Northern Ireland, using panel data taken from the farm business survey for the period from 1994 to 2002. Theoretically, agricultural land rents are a function of expected market returns and expected associated direct payments. The unobservable nature of expected returns means that actual market returns must be used as a proxy for the former in the empirical speciﬁcation. As a consequence, the problem of bias due to expectation error arises. Using a GMM technique to take account of this problem, the results of this study show that the impact of CAP direct payments on rental values depends on the type of payment and on the nature of the production characteristics of the associated agricultural commodity.},

	abstract = {Farm diversiﬁcation is stimulated by the societal demand to transform production countryside into consumption countryside. In most empirical studies on farmers’ decision making for diversiﬁcation, geographical information is either omitted or reduced to a variable that links the farm to an administrative unit. Therefore, the inﬂuence of the exact farm location on farmers’ decision making is often lacking. The paper addresses the role of location, in terms of site speciﬁc natural conditions as well as neighboring dynamics, in inﬂuencing farmers’ decision making to diversify. Moreover, it investigates to what extend low returns from primary production stimulate farmers to ﬁnd new survival strategies, and therefore explains diversiﬁcation. The Gelderse Vallei area, a region in the center of the Netherlands, is used as a case study. For this area an extensive farm survey data could be combined with topographic data and soil maps (GIS). Both the number of activities as well as the kind of activities that are taken up are analyzed. Landscape attractiveness turns out to be a driver of diversiﬁcation. Daily recreation most frequently occurs close to national parks, green services are more likely to occur on relatively wet soils. Activities resulting from diversiﬁcation might produce positive externalities: new activities have the tendency to emerge next to already existing ones, therewith explaining the formation of “hotspots” in the landscape. Finally, diversiﬁcation was found to be sensitive to returns from primary agriculture production.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe a methodology to model the impacts of policy measures within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on farm production, income and prices, and on farmland biodiversity. Two stylised scenarios are used to illustrate how the method works. The effects of CAP measures, such as subsidies and regulations, are calculated and translated into changes in land use and land-use intensity. These factors are then used to model biodiversity with a species-based indicator on a 1 km scale in the EU27. The Common Agricultural Policy Regionalised Impact Modelling System (CAPRI) is used to conduct the economic analysis and Dyna-CLUE (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects) is used to model land use changes. An indicator that expresses the relative species richness was used as the indicator for biodiversity in agricultural areas. The methodology is illustrated with a baseline scenario and two scenarios that include a speciﬁc policy. The strength of the methodology is that impacts of economic policy instruments can be linked to changes in agricultural production, prices and incomes, on the one hand, and to biodiversity effects, on the other e with land use and land-use intensity as the connecting drivers. The method provides an overall assessment, but for detailed impact assessment at landscape, farm or ﬁeld level, additional analysis would be required.},

The weights of economic, social and environmental domains entering the RDI index are derived empirically from the econometrically estimated intra- and inter-regional migration function after selecting the ‘‘best’’ model from various alternative model speciﬁcations (e.g. panel estimate logistic regression nested error structure model, spatial effect models, etc.). The RDI is empirically applied to analysis of the main determinants of rural/regional development in individual rural areas in years 2002–2005 in Poland and Slovakia at NUTS-4 level. Due to its comprehensiveness the RDI Index is suitable both to analysis of the overall level of development of rural areas and to an evaluation of the impacts (impact indicator) of RD and structural programmes at regional levels (NUTS 2–5).},

To increase the understanding of determinants inﬂuencing diversiﬁcation and hence to increase the efﬁciency of policies aiming to support farm diversiﬁcation this paper presents the results of an analysis of diversiﬁcation determinants. The research investigates Dutch farms diversiﬁcation strategies using Farm Structural Survey (FSS) data of 2011 including 70,392 farms. The study uses a binary logit model to determine the characteristics inﬂuencing the diversiﬁcation decision in general. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis for six diversiﬁcation strategies was conducted. Additionally the study categorised the speciﬁc diversiﬁcation activities in order to estimate a multinomial probit model, analysing three choice categories simultaneously. This enables us to compare determinants of farm diversiﬁcation in general with determinants of speciﬁc activities. The analysis includes socio- demographic, economic and geophysical farm characteristics assumed to inﬂuence the diversiﬁcation decision. Even though diversiﬁcation is largely inﬂuenced by similar determinants, we ﬁnd differences that are most pronounced for the adoption of nature conservation strategies. Consequently, it is important for policy makers to target policies at speciﬁc diversiﬁcation activities in order to increase efﬁciency.},

Analyses from in-depth interviews indicate the possible role of new activities in the survival of many farms. The curative potential of this strategy is, however, strongly conditioned by the availability of capital within the household. Therefore, off-farm employment is often the most accessible strategy, not only for the survival of the household, but also for supplementing the income necessary to maintain the farm activities.},

	abstract = {Little work has considered explicitly the role of farm tenancy in inﬂuencing the uptake (or not) of diversiﬁcation activities. The need to examine this link has been heightened because of the 2003 CAP reforms and the decision to tie Single Farm Payment (SFP) entitlement to the land rather than what is produced on that land. The main objective of this paper, therefore, is to examine the nature of diversiﬁcation activities on tenant farms in England, which includes a consideration of how the introduction of the SFP and other CAP reforms may inﬂuence such restructuring processes. Results from a national postal survey, supported by tenant farmer/landlord interviews and a workshop, reveal high rates of farm diversiﬁcation on farms with tenanted land. However, if one takes away contract/hire services the rate of diversiﬁcation on tenant farms is much less. Tenant farms appear to favour more ‘traditional’ diversiﬁcation activities and the results also demonstrate an increasing need to move towards more ‘encultured’ deﬁnitions of farm diversiﬁcation. The second key ﬁnding to emerge from the research relates to the high levels of uncertainty and negativity surrounding the potential impacts of the CAP reforms, and SFP in particular, on farm business behaviour. Tenant farmers were more concerned about levels of SFP and entitlement than future investment decisions, including diversiﬁcation.},

Given this, the search for regional characteristics that exert important influences on income levels or growth rates should take place using spatial econometric methods that account for spatial dependence as well as own and neighbouring region characteristics, the type of spatial regression model specification, and weight matrix.

A knowledge gap exists as to how farmers’ decisions to engage in nonagricultural activities, or to continue farming at all, is affected by landscape characteristics and the farm’s location in the urban–rural system. This paper presents the results of research concerning the impact of spatial factors on diversiﬁcation activities and farm abandonment. Based on a survey conducted among 147 farms in a case study area in Eastern Germany, spatially explicit data on farmers’ diversiﬁcation activities and exit strategies were analysed using two spatial typologies that classify rural attractiveness and farm location on an urban–rural gradient. Results show that while rural attractiveness positively affects the farmers’ decision-making to diversify activities, the degree of urbanisation encourages farm holders to continue farming activity, i.e., the proximity and accessibility to urban consumer markets. Diversiﬁcation rather seems to be associated with rurality and touristic development and not so much with the proximity to urban consumer markets.},

Many studies prescribe rural futures as manifestations of consumption of the countryside by an urban majority. However, many of these macro-images and typologies lack explicit micro-agency. This article illustrates what are the expectations from personal futures in rural areas, where speciﬁcally and by whom. The respondents of a national survey represented the Finnish youth, who described their dream future in 2030 in terms of livelihood, accommodation and lifestyle recipe. Analysis of the dreams resulted in distinct regional proﬁles. Urban-adjacent rural areas are proﬁled as places for a cosy life with spacious housing, home-based activities, nature, privacy and commuting. Rural centres (villages and parishes) had a comparative advantage in small-scale life. The advantage is related to beneﬁts of smallness and economies of proximity: communality, safety and societal involvement. Self-made life attracted the youth to remote rural areas along with opportunities for entrepreneurship, pluriactivity and naturerelated activities. Those of rural origin and a higher age increased the probability of rural destinations in the dreams. The effectiveness of rural, regional and municipal development policy could potentially beneﬁt signiﬁcantly by providing direct responses to the dreams of the youth, based on the research contributions which proﬁle regions for the future at this level of abstraction.},

	abstract = {Based on a graphical analysis, we investigate the impacts of the Fischler Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy on land rental prices and the capitalization of single farm payments (SFP) into land values. The model shows that the degree of capitalization mainly depends on the scarcity/surplus of SFP entitlements relative to eligible hectares, the implementation model (historical versus regional) and the land supply elasticity. If there are more SFP entitlements than eligible hectares, the degree of capitalization into land values may not decline and may even increase due to the inclusion of other supports such as animal premiums in the SFP. We test this hypothesis with an empirical analysis of cross-section data on land rental prices in Bavaria for 2005. Empirical results indicate that decoupled SFP are capitalized into rental prices to a larger degree than the coupled direct payments of the time prior to the reform.},

We apply this framework to two case studies: an open-air market promoting short food supply chains in France, and a partnership between an agricultural cooperative and several solidarity purchase groups (GAS) in Italy. Analysing the trajectories of the two initiatives, we highlight the processes through which new economic models are jointly built via interactions between different actors. Our results open two lines of discussion: one concerning the ‘new economic models' that emerge from the two cases, a second regarding the actors' participation in elaborating and enacting these new models.},

	abstract = {The European Union has introduced agri-environmental measures (AEM) as one key policy tool to counteract the adverse impact of modern agriculture on the environment. Payments for AEM currently account for about 7\% (i.e. nearly 20 billion EUR) of total EU funding for the Common Agricultural Policy programming period 2014-2020. It has been argued that the conditions for disbursing these payments are not rigorous enough to generate environmental benefits. A lack of spatial targeting as well as insufficient consideration of synergies and trade-offs among policy objectives has also been criticized. Here we present the first nationwide analysis on the spatial distribution of agri-environmental payments and their correlation to selected environmental pressure and land-use indicators in Germany. We focused on the AEM payments of the financial year 2014. The results revealed spatial mismatches between the distribution of AEM payments and some indicators for environmental pressures. Uptake of AEM tended to be low in regions with high ammonium deposition or high shares of utilized agricultural area on organic soils. In contrast, AEM uptake was high in regions with a high risk of soil erosion and habitat fragmentation. Moreover, agri-environmental payments varied significantly in relation to land-use attributes across Germany. More farmers received AEM payments in regions with high shares of grassland and Natura 2000 protected areas than did those in regions characterized by intensive agriculture (high numbers of livestock, high area of utilized agricultural area per farm and high natural yield potential). In general, there was a tendency towards spatial separation between highly specialized, productive agricultural areas exposed to comparatively severe environmental pressures and regions with small-scale, low-input farming exposed to lower environmental pressures that maintained a more balanced supply of regulating and cultural ecosystem services. We conclude that AEM need to be more attractive to land managers, especially in productive agricultural regions, in order to increase their effectiveness for environmental impact reduction.},

The review uses population conservation theory, which underpinned the recommendations in the Lawton report (Lawton et al., 2010), to identify eight characteristics of these schemes with this potential. These characteristics form a framework which is used to assess the potential landscape-scale impacts of Countryside Stewardship, the AES recently introduced in England. The Mid Tier of Countryside Stewardship provides financial assistance to facilitators to help farmers organise and manage Farmer Groups. A Farmer Group must consist of four or more neighbouring farmers, who between them farm over 2,000 ha. Each member of a Farmer Group is required to submit an individual application, but each application must demonstrate that it “go[es] beyond [the environmental benefits that] could be delivered by individual holdings acting in isolation”. After the 2017 round, 98 Farmer Groups had been funded, involving 1915 farmer members, covering 451,064 ha. Primarily because of this innovation, Countryside Stewardship is considered to be the most landscape-scale orientated AES offered to farmers in England. A consideration of the evolution towards landscape-scale attributes in environmental land management schemes leads into a discussion of how future changes to four key AES characteristics – identified in the review – may influence how the landscape-scale dimension develops in the next generation of AES.},

A recent strategy adopted by the European Union to address the resulting age imbalance is the Young Farmer Payment which provides an additional payment on top of the average basic payment introduced in the last Common Agricultural Policy reform. The objective of this study is to determine, by means of a behavioural approach, how this payment influenced the incentives of young farmers to stay in the farm. Using the endogenous succession cycle model and the structural modelling technique, we found that the payment affected young farmers’ willingness to stay through its influence on non-economic motivational goals. However, we also found that there are other factors that can be even more influential, such as pessimism about farming, community and family integration, participation in decision making, and the opinion of neighbours, among others. Based on the results, we argue that similar policies could be adopted in other countries, although policies would be more effective in addressing age imbalances if they are accompanied with complementary strategies aimed to deal with the identified social and psychological considerations.},

Erosion, pollution, sealing and decline of the organic matter are just some of the threats that affect one of the primary non-removable resources of the planet. Soils play a vital role in the biodiversity and are the provider of numerous Ecosystem Services that support human life on Earth. Following the withdrawal of the Soil Framework Directive proposal by the European Commission, we investigate how the different MS of the European Union (EU) address sustainable soil management under the pressures of different threats. The methodology used is based on a gap analysis applied to the instruments and/or policies adopted by the MS to contrast the various threats according to their specific level of intensity. The study presents for the first time a systematic review of the current EU policies covering all the regulatory instruments, the economic instruments, the information tools, the monitoring systems, and the research and innovation activities. The comparative analysis of the different approaches adopted by MS reveals the absence of a common EU strategy to address soil protection and the inefficacy of the subsidiary principle in the sustainable management of soil resources especially in the view of addressing the Sustainable Development Goals achieving the targets by 2030. Results show how the lack of a Soil Framework Directive has weakened the possibility to have strong coordination among the MS for soil protection. Each Country is adopting an autonomous legislative framework which reveals a huge dis-homogeneity and un-coherences among approaches.},

Our results support the existence of an inverse relationship between farm size and productive efficiency, where small farms are more efficient than large farms. On average, farms exhibit inefficiency levels of 60\%, suggesting that productivity could be improved substantially. Improving productive efficiency and food security will require farms to operate in ways where the size of cultivated area is matched by nonland production inputs such as labor, fertilizer, and improved seeds. The results highlight the need for policies that could incentivize farmers to adopt productivity-enhancing technologies and, where possible, to allocate excess land to lease markets.},

We show that a positive farm-size productivity relationship could be linked to farmer capital choice. In particular, the productivity advantage of larger farms is likely to diminish as farms use contract services to replace self–owned capital, suggesting that the hire of capital services (hereafter ‘capital outsourcing’) may lift the productivity level of small farms compared to their larger counterparts.},

Using quinquennial Agricultural Census data from 1982 to 2012 the study also compares TFP growth rates across farm sizes to gain insight into whether observed productivity differences are likely to persist. The finding of a strong positive relationship between farm size and TFP suggests that consolidation of production has contributed to recent aggregate productivity growth in the crop sector. The study estimates the extent to which sectoral productivity growth can be attributed to structural change versus other factors including technological change.

Features of Bangladesh’s agriculture help overcome several limitations in testing the inverse farm-size productivity relationship in other developing country settings. A Stochastic Production Frontier (SPF) model is applied using data from three rounds of a household panel survey to simultaneously estimate the production frontier and the technical inefficiency functions. The ‘correlated random effects’ approach is used to control for unobserved heterogeneous household effects. Methodologically, the results suggest that SPF models that ignore the inefficiency function are likely mis-specified, and may result in misleading conclusions on the farm size-productivity relationship. Empirically, the findings confirm that the farm size and productivity relationship is negative, but with the inverse relationship diminishing over time. Total factor productivity growth, driven by technical change, is found to have been robust across the sample. Across farm size groups, the relatively larger farmers experienced faster technical change, which helped them to catch up and narrow the productivity gap with the smaller farmers.},

Our purpose is to provide new perspectives on the debate by bringing together evidence from a set of novel case studies in both rich and poor countries. Common to them are the adoption of total factor productivity (TFP) as the comparative performance measure, and the reliance on panels of farm micro data. The present article presents a synthesis of findings from five case studies in (i) Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda; (ii) Bangladesh; (iii) Brazil; (iv) Australia; and (v) the United States. The preponderance of evidence from these studies suggests that there is no single economically optimal agrarian structure; rather, it appears to evolve with the stage of economic development. Certain farm sizes face relative productivity advantages, such as small farms in Africa. But with economic and market growth, that smallholder advantage will likely attenuate, moving toward constant and eventually increasing returns to size. Yet, importantly, small farms may be quite dynamic, and need not be a drag on agricultural growth until perhaps well into the development process.},

We use the results of choice experiments to assess both the costs incurred by the agent for the provision of biodiversity and the resulting social benefits. We also make a number of novel contributions such as the inclusion of a non-linear non-compliance detection curve, a sensitivity analysis to identify which parameter estimates have a critical impact on PAM results, and analysis of the efficiency of different sanction scenarios. The results suggest that: (i) the second-best solutions differ significantly from the optimal solutions attainable with perfect information, with farmers being strongly over-compensated for the extra costs associated with improved biodiversity; (ii) monitoring levels should be higher; (iii) the sanction system should be tougher. Sensitivity analysis shows the need for accurate estimates of the marginal cost of public funds and the costs and benefits associated with the public goods, which represent the key parameters determining PAM results.},

A generalised propensity score method is applied to a representative sample of 342 Irish dairy farms. Our empirical findings reveal that innovation increases economic sustainability, but not in a linear way. More specifically, economic gains depend on the level of innovation. Small efforts to increase innovation can lead to economic gains of over €200 per hectare. The results also reveal that innovative farmers can achieve higher economic gains by further innovation. Overall, our findings support the current focus of the Irish extension system on fostering the uptake of innovative technologies and practices in order to achieve an economically sustainable expansion of the dairy sector.},

We argue that this is a useful way of generating highly-detailed spatial maps of willingness to pay for environmental conservation, given the costs of collecting data. The data used in this study come from a discrete choice experiment survey of public preferences for the implementation of a new national forest management and protection programme in Poland. We combine these with high-resolution spatial data related to local forest characteristics. Using locally estimated discrete choice models we obtain location-specific estimates of willingness to pay (WTP). Variation in these estimates is explained by characteristics of the forests close to where respondents live. These results are compared with those obtained from a more typical, two stage procedure which uses Bayesian posterior means of the mixed logit model random parameters to calculate location-specific estimates of WTP. We find that there are indeed strong spatial patterns to the benefits of changes to the management to national forests. People living in areas with more species-rich forests and those living nearer bigger areas of mixed forests have significantly different WTP values than those living in other locations. This kind of information potentially enables a better distributional analysis of the gains and losses from changes to natural resource management, and better targeting of investments in forest quality.},

Our results show that firm exit is significantly influenced by positive spatial autocorrelation. Therefore, locations with high exit rates tend to be surrounded by similar ones. However, this phenomenon differs according to the period. In addition, we find that greater local financial development reduces the exit rate in a department, whereas local specialization seems not to exert any effect.},

Pierre Dupraz, an expert in economic evaluations of agri-environment schemes, pointed out past issues of agri-environment schemes including the conflicting objectives and the growing complexity. James Moran, an ecologist who has been involved in the design of results-based schemes, identified the importance of designing schemes that are adaptable and incentivise farmers to improve. Ronan O'Flaherty, a senior policymaker involved in new scheme design in Ireland, shone a light on the policy behind agri-environment schemes and the importance of stakeholder buy-in. Pat Murphy, a knowledge transfer specialist involved in the implementation of agri-environment schemes, discussed the importance that knowledge transfer must play in the future of agri-environment schemes. Together the speakers identified the challenges faced in designing and implementing agri-environment schemes that improve environmental outcomes whether they be action or results-based.},

A Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF) has been developed for the programming period 2007–2013 in response to challenges faced with the evaluation of rural development measures in earlier programming periods. Statistical and multivariate analysis of CMEF baseline (regional characteristics) and input (expenditure) indicator data at the NUTS2 subdivision level is used to compare four typical expenditure allocation patterns (Competitiveness, Environment, Rural Viability, Equal Spending) in terms of associated regional characteristics and development trends. The results suggest expenditure priorities are generally in line with regional needs and that there are some positive development trends, for example higher increase of agricultural labour productivity in the Competitiveness Group, while for environmental topics the level of data required remains unsatisfactory for trend assessment. 17\% of the regions have a budget allocation pattern deviating from other regions with similar characteristics, which could indicate ineffective priority setting. Consistent CMEF data over multiple programming periods would be desirable to support the relationships found and to facilitate time series analysis, but this seems questionable given that the European Commission has discontinued the CMEF in 2014 with further adaptations for the 2014–2020 programming period underway.},

	abstract = {Within the debate about rural development policy (RDP), there has been increasing call for a stronger territorial focus emphasising the potentials, resources and demands of regions. Investments in territorial capital and regional capacity building have been considered as the two main cornerstones of a place-based approach to rural development (OECD, 2006). On the basis of an analytical literature review, we developed a framework to operationalise a place-based approach of RDP. In the proposed framework, the two cornerstones are further subdivided into six topics: “territorial capital” is broken down into physical, human, natural capital, while “capacity building” encompasses modernisation, restructuring and stabilisation of existing territorial assets. Regional RDP expenditure data for the years 2007 to 2011 are used to test the empirical validity of the framework, explore the regional implementation patterns of RD measures and their spatial distribution across European regions. A cluster analysis was applied to identify groups of EU regions with similar settings of RD priorities. In more than half of the regions either natural capital investments or stabilisation represent the dominant priority. Other regions make broader use of rural development topics and are able to combine different ones in their programme designs. The spatial heterogeneity observed in expenditures allocated to the different rural development topics is interpreted as evidence of the place-based character of the EU RD policy. The intervention of various authorities in the programming of RD policy (EU, Member State and regional), as well as the fact that spending ultimately depends on the voluntary uptake of the measures by individual rural actors are discussed as the important factors explaining this heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Regional distinctiveness is supported by the European Union in rural development policy. However, there is little information about the spatial distribution of the potential for rural development across Europe. The concept of territorial capital is used to consider spatial characteristics in assessing the capacity for rural development. Expert-based descriptions of territorial capital are translated into mappable proxies to locate regions with development capacities in intensive agriculture, off-farm employment, rural tourism and conservation. Combining these potentials, the capacity for multiple functions within regions is assessed. A partial validation of the expert-based weighing of territorial capital is done by comparison with an empirical approach based on logistic regression. The results indicate strong variation between regions in rural development potentials. In Western Europe, regions with high rural tourism probability also share a high potential for conservation while opportunities for intensive agriculture and off-farm employment are generally low. In other parts of Europe these correlations are less pronounced. Several regions offer limited potential in all four considered functions while few regions have potential in all four functions. The assessment provides policymakers with assistance in identifying competitive rural development projects. Targeting rural development policies to high potential areas may increase policy efficiency.},

Using the French Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), we computed an intensity indicator based on input costs per ha (“IC/ha”). Common variables between the FADN and four other datasets were included in a two steps multinomial regression to estimate the IC/ha value of each Small Agricultural Region (“SAR”, units with homogeneous agro-ecological characteristics with mean width = 22.4 km). The local indicator of spatial association was used to reveal clusters where SARs with homogeneous intensities were aggregated. We showed that the IC/ha indicator displayed a broad intensity gradient where production types were fairly evenly distributed. Multinomial regression models provided a reliable estimate of the intensity indicator (mean cross-validation error = 23\%, mean r2 = 0.7) with SAR resolution. At the scale of France and within the two intensity extremes ({\textless}300 D /ha and {\textgreater}500 D /ha), SARs were signiﬁcantly aggregated in several clusters. Most low-input SARs were aggregated into a large cluster ranging across several mountainous regions. Less high-input SARs were signiﬁcantly aggregated.

They are essential for biodiversity conservation in rural environments, and their presence is an important indicator of the effectiveness of different EU policies that aim to support biodiversity in agricultural areas.

Previous studies have analysed the landscape along an urban-rural-natural gradient, beginning with Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps. Building up from this baseline, this paper integrates spatial analysis methods with statistical data related to agricultural practices and their intensity, with the aim of mapping and assessing HNVf in a portion of the Veneto Plain, north-east Italy. In particular, this paper presents a methodology for the identification of HNVf applied to two datasets: (i) the first encompassing only LULC data and (ii) the second encompassing also statistical data on agricultural practices. The aim is to demonstrate how this additional information improves the identification of HNVf. In the first step, a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique is applied to a reclassified LULC map, in order to calculate continuous intensity indicators. A Principal Components Analysis and an ISODATA Cluster Analysis are then performed respectively to remove redundant information and to identify the different landscape structures of the study area. The second analysis follows the same steps, with the difference that LULC intensity indicators are analysed in combination with data on crop rotations, irrigation and livestock from a census survey. The first analysis returns a map of the landscape driven only by different intensities of land use. The second returns a map where the statistics on agricultural practices allow for a better characterisation of the natural value of the landscape. Agricultural statistics improved the results, since they allow the discrimination of lower intensity clusters within the cultivated areas, which are traditionally excluded from HNVf by considering only the land cover. The comparison between the results of the two analyses shows that the combined use of the agricultural statistics determines a more detailed representation of the study area, that allows a better differentiation of the agricultural areas between HNVf and non-HNVf, leading to an improvement of the HNVf identification methodology. The benefit of using additional information can be therefore of interest for territorial planning, with the ultimate aim of promoting biodiversity conservation.},

A two outputs (livestock and crops) and four inputs (labor, capital, land, and material) translog cost function was estimated from national time series (1948–2011) data. Results indicate that payments do not induce output-biased technical change. We do find evidence of Hicksian bias that is land using and material input saving attributable to support payments. Global computable general equilibrium simulations suggest that price and output effects of discontinuing direct payments are 1/4 to 1/3 the size once the bias effects are incorporated.},

	abstract = {In this paper the price volatility of land in Poland is examined during the years 1992-2016. The analysis concentrates particularly on stationarity, variation and GARCH. Differences in land price changes in particular provinces in Poland are presented and land prices in Poland are compared with other EU countries. The land market in Poland is diverse. Purchasers can buy land from private owners in the market and from the government’s Agricultural Property Agency. Generally, land offered by the Agricultural Property Agency is cheaper, but it is also more difficult to purchase. The authors of the paper used and analyzed quarterly price data from the main Statistical Office in Warsaw in PLN. The survey found high variability for land prices in Poland. The price of agricultural land has increased significantly since the integration of Poland into the EU. In 2016 the average price of land from the (APA) Agricultural Property Agency increased by 791\% and the average price of private agricultural land increased by 690.2\% in comparison to 2004. The prices of land differ regionally in Poland. In 2016 compared to 2005 the price of land increased the most in Warmińsko-Mazurskie voivodeship (587,2\%), Opolskie voivodeship (547,8\%) and Lubuskie voivodeship (534,9\%). In 2016 in comparison to 2005 the price of agricultural land increased the least in Małopolskie voivodeship (252,6\%), Podlaskie voivodeship (295,0\%) and Łódzkie voivodeship (304,9\%). The study presents the descriptive statistics of agricultural land. The coefficient of variation of price changes in the years 2005-2016 was the highest in Slovakia (69,8\%), Romania (60,4\%) and Estonia (59,4\%) and the lowest in Italy (9,2\%) and France (12,1\%). The ADF test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test) shows that the agricultural land prices data can be classified as not stationary. The implication of the GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model of price volatility of agricultural land is that conditional volatility cannot be confirmed.},

Despite longstanding interventions to promote specialist agricultural education, farmer attainment metrics remain disappointing. Likewise participation rates in lifelong learning are much lower for farmers than for the working population generally. Based on experience in other sectors, there is potential to apply measures on minimum practitioner competency, practitioner accreditation and continuing professional development to agriculture. As part of this policy framework, a share of the future EU agriculture budget should be placed in a Knowledge Fund to be allocated in the form of Knowledge Vouchers. Given ingrained barriers to change that must be overcome, farmers using Knowledge Vouchers to finance training, skills and competency development should be rewarded with a cash payment. Farmers that do not engage in education and lifelong learning would see subsidy payments reduced. The prescribed policy change would improve overall value for public money and align with proposals for Member States to develop Strategic Plans to meet economic, environmental and social objectives, as part of post-2020 CAP reforms.},

Subsidies are one of the tools to shape a concentrated market with goals of reducing regulation cost and accomplishing quality control. This gives a serious concern that subsidies would generate a less competitive dairy industry. We construct a parametric model and use the firm-level panel data, specifically the top eight dairy firms, to test if government subsidies strengthen the market power in the dairy industry. Our empirical results indicate government subsidies have a negative impact on the Lerner Index for the top privately-owned firms, but no significant effect on state-controlled ones after controlling for advertising, time trend, and proprietorship. It is possible that the subsidies give more room for private firms to increase the scale or suppress the price, which eventually reduces the market power and benefits dairy customers in the downstream.

However, up to now no comprehensive assessment of the territorial impacts of the CAP has been achieved. This article summarises the main findings of a recent study which was carried out under the European Union's ESPON programme on this issue. The regional analysis suggests that, at present, the CAP is not contributing towards the goal of more balanced and sustainable development across European territory. This finding is both valid for the more “traditional” CAP (Pillar 1) and the Rural Development measures, referred to as Second Pillar measures, indicating the emerging priority for these types of instruments. Yet, the great variation in the RDP priorities and implementation in the Member States underscore the wide scope for taking account of the spatial dimension more explicitly. In addition, the numerous best practice examples and the political support for RD action point to the untapped potential of local activities in rural areas. Strengthening the link to the spatial cohesion objectives is therefore a prerequisite for securing support by European citizens for future CAP payments.},

	abstract = {While the evolution of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) until 2013 is clear, European Union (EU) budgetary pressures and the perceived unfairness of the distribution of CAP support across Member States has lead to uncertainty over the design of the CAP post 2013. One comprehensive reform option being considered is the implementation of an EU wide flat area payment (EUWFAP) system and a reduction of the total budget available for direct payments. It is hypothesised that the implementation of this policy proposal would lead to significant changes in the distribution of the EU budget and to the redistribution of agricultural production between the Member States, which could hinder the implementation of the proposal. This paper evaluates the rationality of the EUWFAP, based on the analysis of its budgetary and market impacts. Using the AGMEMOD 2020 combined model, the introduction of the EUWFAP in 2013 is compared with a baseline continuation of the current policy. Results suggest that there would be minor negative impacts on the agricultural production at the EU level, but that more substantial impact for some commodities, most notably beef, and could occur in the individual EU Member States. An important outcome of such a policy reform would be a substantial change in the budget allocation between Member States, which could help mitigate the budgetary tensions between the Member States.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on the use of a spatial analysis framework to assess the consequences for business incomes of alternative area-bases for Pillar 1 CAP Single Farm Payments, integrating spatial data from both biophysical and socio-economic domains. The results from the Scotland analysis are likely to have wider significance for policy makers confronting decisions on how best to implement reforms of Pillar 1 CAP payments elsewhere in the EU. Introduction of area-based payment to replace historic entitlement is particularly challenging in regions with a wide range of bio-physical conditions that are spatially heterogeneous and only weakly related to intensity of agricultural use, management or previous support. The analysis shows that, while the basis of payments and payment rates can have substantial effects on the nature of the impact, it is the change to an area-based payment system alone that has the biggest redistributive impact. For Scotland, there are larger numbers of businesses that gain rather than lose, and, because the average losses are much larger than the average gains, a move towards area-based payments is likely to encounter strong opposition and only weak support from the agricultural community. In all the options for area-based payments examined, there is substantial redistribution between agricultural sub-sectors and between geographical regions. Substantial reductions in support affect agricultural sub-sectors that are significant for the wider agri-food sector (cereals, general cropping, dairy and lowland livestock) and regions where agriculture plays a significant role in the economy (particularly south-west Scotland). Yet the greater redistribution quantified by this research is within sub-sectors; that is from businesses with more intensive management to those with more extensive. Such within-sector redistributions will have policy significance and mean that analysis of the consequences of area-based payment options conducted only at sub-sectoral level is likely to be inadequate. It is concluded that the analysis approach used has successfully revealed the potential consequences of area-based CAP support payment options and this has been of direct value by informing ongoing negotiations on reform of the CAP. However, the research also highlights the serious challenges that remain in defining schemes that meet the objectives of policy makers, can be administered cost-effectively and are politically acceptable. The research may thus have implications for other EU member states considering how best to implement area-based Pillar 1 payment schemes.},

In this reform 'single farm payments' have been introduced which are based on direct payments during the reference period 2000-2002. We use statistics of such payments to explore the distribution patterns across farm holdings in EU member states. The results show, that direct payments are skewed towards a small number of very large holdings in a few member states. To show their distributional consequences on farm household incomes, we use data from the Farm Accountancy Data network in Austria. The analysis shows that direct payments do not contribute towards a more equal income distribution of farm households.},

Our results indicate that cotton production gradually decreases as more decoupled policies are adopted. Moreover, the fully decoupled payment is found to be non-production neutral since it indirectly affects producers’ decisions through the wealth effect. Katranidis, Stelios D.; Kotakou, Christina A.},

	abstract = {Rural land-use in the European Union (EU) is strongly influenced by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) because it directly affects the relative profitability of different land-use options. Since 2000, the CAP has been heavily reformed. In particular, in Sweden, the 2003 CAP reform was followed by substantial shifts in agricultural land allocation. However, this land-use change has barely been studied empirically beyond the net changes of land-use categories. In order to better understand the transformation of the land-use system, all transitions between land-use categories and changes within existing categories need to be considered. This article presents an analysis of agricultural land-use change between 2002 and 2010 in a landscape in southern Sweden. The inter-category land transitions were identified and quantified by using a spatially explicit field-level resolution dataset. The intra-category change of utilization intensity was assessed for grasslands by using standard yields and forage consumption estimates. Substantial shifts in chains of connected inter-category land transitions were found between cereals, temporary grasses, permanent pastures and fallow lands. The grassland utilization analysis showed a growing gap between grassland area and forage consumption. These results indicate concentration of agricultural production to better quality land and a growing number of land-idling farms in the region. The CAP single farm payment scheme is discussed in the light of these findings.},

The EU Common Agricultural Policy reform implemented in 2006 means shifting farm subsidies from production output and capital to farmland. Since decoupling seems to be a prominent trend in agricultural policy, we also simulate a case in which some national subsidies are decoupled from production as well. The decoupled support is tied equally to the hectares of arable land owned by farmers, other entrepreneurs, white and blue collar workers, pensioners and other households. This study takes the ownership structure of farmland between these household groups explicitly into account. We evaluate the overall impact of these changes on agricultural production, income and the welfare of various households. The computable general equilibrium GemRur simulation model of Finland is our working tool. We find that decoupling farm payments from production, especially if extended to national subsidies, will increase agricultural and food prices and decrease agricultural and food production. The decoupling has the greatest impact on the income and welfare of farmers. The impacts on other households and sectors are clearly smaller but not negligible.},

However, these studies assume that the previous reform, under Agenda 2000, already decoupled arable crop direct payments to a considerable extent, while beef premiums were linked more closely to production. Our main objective in this paper is to test the sensitivity of these results to this questionable modelling of Agenda 2000 direct payments, which neglects eligibility rules and land market imperfections. Our analysis reveals that the effects of the reform on both arable crop and beef production are always negative, however the Agenda 2000 direct payments are modelled. On the other hand, we show that, when the eligibility rules and land market imperfections are acknowledged, the production reducing effects may be much larger for arable crops than for beef.

Through an extensive literature review, this paper aims to interpret why some rural areas decline while some others do not. The findings show that it is by the interactions between rural areas and the external environment that rural communities either grow, decline or even vanish. The paper emphasizes the necessity to improve rural communities' resilient capacity through adjusting their internal components' function and structure to survive the external changes. In this process, rural livelihood diversification, the creation of market oriented institutions and strong social capital are considered to enhance rural resilience and build up sustaining rural communities. Finally, three conditions for sustainable rural development in the knowledge economy are discussed: 1) development of new economic activities that can respond to potential urban demand; 2) local entrepreneurship that can establish and expand these new activities; and 3) social capital that can support the entrepreneurship in new activities with access to credits, labor, human capital, external markets and external knowledge for learning and innovation.},

The main conclusions are listed as follows. (1) The areas, including the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the northwestern areas, were the most attractive destinations for rural migrants. (2) The inter-provincial rural migration pattern is close to the total rural migration pattern, but is different from the intra-provincial pattern. (3) In general, job opportunities in the secondary industry, rural income, rural investment, and the local economic levels were all main drivers for rural migration. The driving mechanisms varied in the eastern, central, and western provinces. To support China's efforts in rural revitalization, regionally different policies, urban-rural integration, and new economic factors are suggested and highlighted from the perspective of rural migration.},

On the other hand, the paper responds to recent calls about the need to identify incentives other than monetary payments to promote farmers participation. Methodologically, the study consists of a choice experiment exploring the willingness of farmers in Germany, Switzerland, and Spain to participate in a tree planting measure. According to our findings, the resistance of farmers to participate in coordinated programs is not insurmountable and has to do with transaction costs as well as beliefs about other farmers’ behavior. Similarly, having conservation programs recommended by farmers can encourage other farmers to participate. Finally, different conservation framings can affect the resistance of farmers to participate depending on the emphasis made on the environmental benefits that farmers obtain from the programs. Overall, the findings illustrate the interest of further integrating farmers in the design of agro-environmental schemes and, further testing the feasibility of coordinated schemes in light of the influence of both monetary and social incentives.},

In diesem Beitrag wird untersucht, wie angemessen die Gemeinsame Agrarpolitik (GAP) der Europäischen Union zur Lösung der Probleme im Zusammenhang mit der Entwicklung ländlicher Gebiete in den neuen Mitgliedsstaaten ist. Es wird argumentiert, dass die Linderung der Strukturprobleme in den ländlichen Gebieten dieser Staaten zwar eine zentrale Rolle für eine wirksame Integration von Mittel- und Osteuropa in die EU spielt, doch dass die GAP für diese Aufgabe schlecht geeignet ist. Insgesamt wurde die GAP für eine wirksame Eingliederung der mittel- und osteuropäischen Beitrittsländer nicht ausreichend reformiert; vielmehr steht sie für das Versagen der EU, sich angemessen anzupassen und von einer ausschließlich westeuropäischen Institution zu einer gesamteuropäischen Organisation weiterzuentwickeln. Gemeinsame Agrarpolitik (GAP) Entwicklung ländlicher Gebiete Erweiterung Mittel- und Osteuropa Gorton M., Hubbard C. y Hubbard L. El desatino de la transferencia de políticas de la UE: Por qué la PAC no encaja en Europa central y oriental, Regional Studies. En este artículo evaluamos en qué medida es apropiada la Política Agrícola Común (PAC) de la Unión Europea para solucionar los problemas relacionados con el desarrollo rural en los nuevos Estados Miembros. Sostenemos que si bien la mitigación de los problemas estructurales a los que se enfrentan las zonas rurales en estos países es indispensable para superar el reto de una integración eficaz de los países de Europa central y oriental en la UE, la PAC no es nada adecuada para esta tarea. En general la PAC se reformó de modo insuficiente para acomodar eficazmente la adhesión de los países de Europa central y oriental y representa un fallo de la UE que no ha sido capaz de adaptarse adecuadamente desde una institución exclusiva de los países occidentales de Europa a una apropiada organización paneuropea.

	abstract = {Agriculture remains one of the dominant activities in rural areas across the European Union (EU), not least in respect of land use and its impact on landscapes. The Agenda 2000 reform of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduced rural development as an integrated part of agricultural policy. The present study focuses on the second pillar of CAP. Multifunctional farming, more than any other rural activity, has a role to play in integrating the natural environment with the cultural landscape and socio-economic development. The question of how multifunctional agriculture can facilitate sustainable rural development is addressed in terms of mechanisms and inherent possibilities. Results from a case study in Östergötland in Sweden are discussed in relation to five other European case studies. Some main findings are that Pillar 2 has made it possible for rural inhabitants to continue living in rural areas and that the policies are effective in identifying and supporting new opportunities for farm diversification. The traditional agricultural landscape can be seen as a key component in various diversification activities in rural areas, contributing to economic as well as social and environmental sustainability.},

	abstract = {The effects of globalization have often been adverse for the agricultural sector, especially its most vulnerable element—the small farm. The importance of the agricultural sector as a whole and small farms in the sense of ensuring food security, employment and viability of rural areas, implies a necessity to support the sector and small farms in particular. For this purpose, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU) seeks to boost the sustainability of agriculture in multiple dimensions. The 2013 reform of the CAP has provided a particularly strong impetus towards this direction. This paper establishes an indicator system to quantify the effects of the CAP direct payments on the socioeconomic sustainability of small farms. Expert survey and multi‐criteria assessment are used to this end. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is applied for the multi‐criteria analysis. Lithuania is taken as a case study. The results show that, in the case of Lithuania, the direct payment system did not contribute to the improvement in socioeconomic sustainability of small farms up until 2013 CAP reform when its impact became undeniable.},

We consider that this is consistent with the fact that just over a third of manufacturing FDI in the country is located in the automotive sector. Moreover, we find positive direct and indirect effects of human capital, agglomeration, and states’ fiscal margins. Based on the results of this research, attraction of FDI should be considered in a regional context and not only from a local perspective.},

A more nuanced picture would be achieved by unpacking intervention in different policy areas at the micro-level and analyzing the channels through which policy contributes to economic growth. The paper reviews the main direct and indirect transmission channels in three areas: research and innovation; support to enterprises; and infrastructure. In this respect, impact evaluations at beneficiary and, in particular, firm level offer a rich potential source of evidence and need to be systematically built into data collection and evaluation of post-2020 Cohesion Policy.},

However, most of the current studies ignored the effects of social connections on the spatial distribution of rural settlements. This study proposed a multi-objective spatial reconstruction model for rural settlements based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The model considers intervillage social connections as one of the reconstruction objectives together with land-use quantity, spatial compactness, land-use suitability and relocation distance. Based on a questionnaire survey, the social connection strength between villages was measured from spatial and nonspatial aspects. The model was calibrated for the Chengui Township of Hubei Province in Central China. Five modeling scenarios for rural settlement reconstruction were designed according to potential development modes used in practice. A comparison of the reconstruction results of the different scenarios was performed to verify the applicability of the model and to analyze the joint interaction of the spatial objectives and social connections during the restructuring of rural settlements. The results indicated that five scenarios were effectively and robustly implemented using the proposed model. Social connections had a direct effect by guiding the restructuring direction of rural settlements. This study advances our understanding of the influence of social connections on rural settlement reconstruction and provides a useful exploratory tool for policymakers and rural planners in formulating reasonable reconstruction plans.},

This point was briefly addressed with respect to global Moran’s I, but it has not been widely used. One reason may be that the most commonly used spatial analysis and GIS software packages do not support power analysis. Thus, apart from using the code for saddle-point approximation, applications have been restricted to employing normal approximations. An implementation of the exact distributions for global and local Moran’s I, which are integrated into the R-package spdep, is presented. Furthermore, assuming a simultaneous autoregressive spatial data generating scheme, substantial cases are provided, demonstrating the drawbacks and potential flaws of using the normal approximation in power calculations. The results confirm that, particularly for local Moran’s I, due to the smallness of sets of neighborhoods, this practice may potentially lead to errors of inference. An example concerned with Upper-Austrian migration, where using the exact distribution leads to different conclusions, is presented as well.},

The aim was to measure the overall impact of all of the Rural Development Funds, covering all measures within the program. Two indices of local well-being were used: the multi-dimensional, local-variables-based Regional Development Index that measures the overall level of regional development and a simple, migration-based index as a proxy for perceived quality of life. Generalized propensity score matching, and difference-in-differences estimation techniques were employed to evaluate the impact of subsidies. Irrespective of how the amount of support was calculated, the measure of local well-being, or the methodology employed, the impact was not signiﬁcant, and was sometimes even negative. This casts doubt on the effectiveness of Rural Development Policy in Hungary.},

(Reg Sci Urban Econ, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1016/j. regsciurbeco.2018.04.013). Given reliable interregional trade estimates, the simulations are based on a linear predictor which utilizes different regional interdependency matrices according to assumptions about interregional trade post-Brexit. The results indicate that heightened barriers to trade will evidently cause job-shortfalls both in the UK and across the EU, but it is also shown that there is a considerable amount of asymmetry in the outcomes across regions and sectors.},

In particular, low-growth regions in Southern Europe stand to benefit the most from improvements in government quality, while in low-income regions of Central and Eastern Europe, investments in the traditional drivers of growth remain the main factors behind successful economic trajectories.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the core research question – how can we understand the policy processes leading to the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform? It utilizes the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) perspective as an explanatory framework for these purposes in a European Union (EU) policy area which normally lies outside ACF applications. In the ACF, it is assumed that advocacy coalitions will resist information that challenges the policy core beliefs of decision actors. This characteristic is even stronger in semi-federalist systems such as the EU. Hence, a high degree of consensus is required to change the policy core, as was the case with the 2003 CAP reform. The article shows that the ACF can be expanded to explain the CAP reform. It also demonstrates that the preconditions identified by the ACF for a successful consensus process were fulfilled in the reform process. The onset of the BSE crisis and the emergent international trade negotiations meant that the status quo was no longer unacceptable. Most of the negotiations leading up to the CAP reform were held in private and took a great deal of time. Commissioner Fischler was willing to act as facilitator in the process and strove to make the reform process as non-normative as possible. However, in order to accommodate the criticism of the ACF for not taking collective action problems serious, it is also observed that new forms of non-trivial coordination occurred, namely discursive coordination, which became the most frequently used form of coordination during the 2003 CAP reform process and which is much less problematic as far as collective action problems are concerned.},

The overall hypothesis is that intensiveness of agricultural production corresponds to the willingness to reform the CAP. Political CAP positions, together with the development of member states’ structural fundamentals, are analysed using cluster analysis. The results show that EU enlargements have extensified agricultural production at the EU level, and that extensive agricultural production in a member state is often an indicator of reduced willingness to reform. However, the intensiveness of agricultural production is only part of the explanation. Moreover, negotiation tactics play an important role for the positions on the CAP.},

In this picture, the policy process is insulated from other policy concerns, has a distinctive system of actors and institutional structures, and is rooted in extensive governmental intervention in the market and the redistribution of resources from taxpayers to food producers. Recently there have been suggestions that a ‘post-exceptional’ agricultural politics has emerged, which is more market-driven, has reduced state intervention, and where policies reflect influences relating to non-food issues such as the environment. This contribution discusses the concepts of compartmentalization and exceptionalism and then applies ‘indicators of change’ to a case study of the 2013 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). It concludes that the reform provides evidence for ‘shallow’ post-exceptionalism where a historically persistent agricultural policy subsystem has opened up to new actors, incorporated some programme change but left the ideational framework largely intact.},

It shows that the transfer of authority to international institutions may transform an external factor into a permanent influence on domestic policy. The transfer of authority in agriculture to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT – now included in the WTO) in 1994 led to the introduction of a dormant clause on export subsidies in all subsequent EU CAP regulations. This clause provided the legal foundation for the 2015 EU decision to remove export subsidies. Multilateral pressure (i.e. the demands of third countries in GATT/WTO negotiations) is not the only determinant of CAP, but it is important, and affected by the GATT/WTO having authority on agriculture.},

This discussion on the driving forces of CAP reform links to broader theoretical questions on the role of budgetary politics, globalisation of public policy and paradigm shift in explaining policy change. In this article, the Health Check reforms of 2007/2008 are assessed. They were probably more ambitious than first supposed, although it was a watered-down package agreed by ministers in November 2008. We conclude that the Health Check was not primarily driven by budget concerns or by the supposed switch from the state-assisted to the multifunctional policy paradigm. The European Commission's wish to adopt an offensive negotiating stance in the closing phases of the Doha Round was a more likely explanatory factor. The shape and purpose of the CAP post-2013 is contested with divergent views among the Member States.},
